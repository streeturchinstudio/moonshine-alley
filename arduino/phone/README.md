# Usage

Place up to two audio files on the SD card:

  - `audio.wav` - default audio file to be played
  - `audio2.wav` - alternate audio file to played when PIN 3 is HIGH


 # Logs

 The logs generated are human readable, but also can be processed and visualized with the `processLogs.py` script. Included in this project is a [config file](./logging.yaml) that associates log lines with events.
